# Contributing to example-java-sb-maven

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github Enterprise

We use github.dxc.com to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github.dxc.com So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests.

The simplest way to contribute to a project:

1) Fork the project into your personal repo space
2) Clone it to your local system
3) Make a new branch
4) Make your changes
5) Push it back to your repo
6) Click the Compare & pull request button
7) Click Create pull request to open a new pull request

If the reviewers ask for changes, repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more commits to your pull request.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.dxc.com/org/project_name/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and samples

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code or image if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

We *love* thorough bug reports.
